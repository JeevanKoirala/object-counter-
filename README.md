# object-counter-
this is a simple object counter that can count objects in a image video or live cam..
At first i used the small yolov5 but it wasn't that much accurate so to make it more accurate i used the medium one
torch hub is used to load the model from ultralytics
shutil is used for cache management to prevent errors with model loading
and further on switching to the medium model was suggested by AI and the shutil too...
so a little bit AI was used here for switching.....
